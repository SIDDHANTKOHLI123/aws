Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC support both the IPv4 and IPv6 addressing protocols. By default, Amazon VPC uses the IPv4 addressing protocol; you can't disable this behavior. When you create a VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block (a range of private IPv4 addresses). You can optionally assign an IPv6 CIDR block to your VPC and assign IPv6 addresses from that block to instances in your subnets.


A private IPv4 address is an IP address that's not reachable over the Internet. You can use private IPv4 addresses for communication between instances in the same VPC. In order to communicate with www(internet) you should use NAT gateway.


A public IP address is an IPv4 address that's reachable from the Internet. You can use public addresses for communication between your instances and the Internet.

Elastic Ip Address
An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is allocated to your AWS account, and is yours until you release it. By using an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account. Alternatively, you can specify the Elastic IP address in a DNS record for your domain, so that your domain points to your instance.

If you stop and restart instance then its public ip is released and new ip address(public) is given. Ifwe want same ip address(public) then we can use elastic ip
