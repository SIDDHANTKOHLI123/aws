Security Groups are fundamental of netwrok security in AWS
tHEY control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances

Security group only contains allow rules
Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

Security groups are acting as a "firewall" on ec2 instances
They regulate 
 - access to the ports
 - authorized ip ranges - ipv4 and ipv6
 -control of inbound network(from other to the instance)
 -contro; of outbound network(from the instance to other)
 
 
 - Security group can be multiple instances
 -Locked down to a region/VPC combination
 -Does live "outside" the ec2 -if traffic is blocked the ec2 instance wont see it
 -Its good to maintain one seprate security group for ssh access
 -If your application is not accessible , then its security group issue
 -If your application gives a "connection refused" eroor, then it's an appication eroor or it's not launched
  -All inbound traffic is bloecked by defaukt
  -All outbound traffic is authorized by default
  
  
  Classic ports 
  22 ssh(secure shell) - log in to linux instance
  21 ftp(file transfer protocol) -uploafd files into a file share
  22 sftp (secure file transfer protocol) -upload files using ssh
  80 http-access unsecured websites
  443- https -access secured websites
  3389 rdp(remote dekstop isntance_ -log into a windows instance
  
  
  SSH
  ----------------
  iF YOU HAVE MAC/LINUX / WINDOWS >=10 then ssh would work good
   for windows greater or than less 10 you can use putty too
   Ec2 instance connect can be valid for all type of os
   
   
   - SSH is one of the most important function. It allows you to controla remote machine ,all using a command line
   
   ensure there are no spaces in opem file
   
  ssh -i firstinstanceec2.pem ec2-user@44.203.194.73
  
  where cmd is done where pem while is prestn and then @is your public ip
  
  -check whoami
  -check ping google.com
  
  ctrl+d to exit from session
  
  For putty (you need ppk file , if you was have key ass pppk file then thats good else go to puttygen add your pem file , private key then download ppk file)
  
  go to putty then go to session , add instance name with ip , then go to connection --> ssh --> auth then browse and add that file to and then go to session and save connect
  
  if you have permission issues when you add pem file then go to the file right click stop inheritenance , add your user and give it all permissions
  
  ec2 instance connect post a temporary ssh key so you need not to put it
  
ec2 instances role demo
-------------------------------------
  Provide aws credentials to ec2 by creating a role and attaching the iamaccessreadonly role to the ec2 security . Do not do aws configure to add key and password to it .
