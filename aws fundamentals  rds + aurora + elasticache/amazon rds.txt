RDS sstands for Relational Database Service
It is a managed DB service for Db use SQL as a query language
It allows you to create databases,the RDS service, in the cloud,and these databases will be managed by AWS
 -Postgres
 -MySQL 
 -MariaDB
 -Oracle
 -Microsoft SQL Server
 -Aurora(AWS Proprietary Database)

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2
- rds is a managed service :
  -Automated provisioning , OS patching
  -Continous backups and restore to specific timestamp
  -Monitoring dashboards
  -Read replicas for improved read performance
  -Multi AZ setuo for DR (Disaster recovery)
  -Maintenance windows for upgrades
  -Scaling capability (verical and horizontal)
  -Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)

-But you cant SSH into your instances

RDS Backup 
 -Backups are automatically enabled in RDS
 -Automated backups :
   -Daily full backup of the databse (during the maintenance window)
   -Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
   - => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
   - 7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days)

-DB Snapshots
  -Manually triggered by user
  -Retention of backup for as long as you want 

RDS -Storage Auto Scaling
 -helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
 -When RDS detects you can running out of free databse storage , it scales automatically
 - Avoid manually scaling your database storage
 - You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold(max limit of db storage)
 -Automatically modify storage if :
   - Free storage is less than 10% of allocated sotrage
   -Low -storage lasts at least 5 minutes
   - 6 hrs have passed since last modification
-Useful for application with unpredictable data load
- is avaialble for all db engines (postgres,sql,etc)
