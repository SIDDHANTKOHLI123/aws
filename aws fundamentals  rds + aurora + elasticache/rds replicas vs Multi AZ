RDS Read Replicas for read scalability

- upto 5 read replicas
-Within az , cross az or cross region
-replication is ASYNC so reads are eventually consitent
-Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
- Applications must update the connection string yo leverage read replicas

Use cases
-You have a production database that is taking on normal load
-Ypou want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
-You can create a Read replica to run the new workload there
-The production application is unaffected
-Read replicas are used for select(=read) only kind of statements (not insert,update,delete)

RDS Reas Replicas -Network Cost
-in AWS there's a netwrok cost whern data goes from one AZ to another
-For RDS read replicas within the same region , then you dont have to pay fee


RDS Multi AZ(Disaster recovery)
-SYNC replication
-One DNS name - auotmatoc app failover to standy
-increase availabilty
-Failover in case of loss of AZ , Loss of network , instance or storage failure
_No manual intervemtion
-Not used for scaling

- NOte :------ The read replicas can be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery(DR)



rDS -FROM SIngle az to Multi az
-zero downtime operation (no need to stop the db)
-Just click on "modify the databse"

-tHE FOLLOWING HAPPENS INTERNALLY -
  -A snapshot is taken
  - A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
  -Synchornization is established between the two databses
