Aurora High Availability and Read Scalong
 -  6 copies if your data across 3 az
    - 4 copies out of 6 needs for writes
    - 3 copies out of 6 need for reads
    -Self healing with peer to peer replication
    -Storage is striped across 100s of volumes
    -Shared storage volume REplication + Self Healing +Auto Expanding
    
  -one Aurora instance takes writes(master)
  -automated faialover for master in less than 30n secs
  -Matser + upto 15 Aurora Read replicas serve reads
  -Support for Cross region replication
  
  
    Aurora DB Cluster
    Reader endpoint - connection Load balancing , it is connected to all read replicas
    Writer endpoint -pointing to master
