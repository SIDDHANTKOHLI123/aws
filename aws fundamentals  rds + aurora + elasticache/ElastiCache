The same way RDS is to get manages RElational Databases
Elasticahce is to get managed Redis or Memcached
Cahces are in memort databases with really high performance , low latency
Help reduce load off databses fpr read intensive workloads
Helps make your application stateles
AWS takes care of OS maintenace /patching , optimizations, setup , config , monitoring , failure recovery or backuos
Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes


ElastCache Solution Architecture -DB Cache
- Application queries ElastiCache , if not available , get from RDS and store in ELastiCache
- Hleps relieve load in RDS
-Cache must have an invalidation stratergy to make sure only the most current data is used in there


ElastCache Solution Architecture -User Session Store
-User logs into any of the aplpication
-The application writes the session data into ElastiCcahe
-The user hits another instance of our application
-The instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in


ElastiCache - REDIS VS Memcached
-Multi AZ with auto -failover
-Read replicas to scale reads and have high availability
-Data durability using AOF persistence
-backup- and restore features


MemCached
 -multi node for partioning of data (sharding)
 -No g=high avaialability(replication)
 -non persistent
 -no backup and restore
 -multo threases architecture


ElastCcahe Security 

 - do not support IAM authentication
 
 REDIS AUTH
  -you can ser a 'password/token' when you create a REdis cluster
  -this is an extra level of security for your cache (on top of security groups)
-SUpport SSL in fligh encryption


Mmemcacehed
- Supports SASL-bases authentication (adanaced)


Patterns For ElastiCcaged
-lazy loading : all the read data is cached , data can become stale in cache
-write through - adds or update data in the cache when written to a DB (No stale data)
- session store -  store temporary session data in a cache (using ttl features)

Use cases of ElatCache (Redis)
-Gaming leaderboards are computationally complex
-redis sorted sets guarantee both uniqueness and element ordered
-each time a new element is addes , it's ranked in real time , then added in correct order
