RDS security 

At rest encryption
 -Possibility to encrypt the master and read replicas with AWS KMS -AES-256 Ecnryprion
 -encryption has to be deined at launch time
 -If the master is not encrypted , the read replicas cannot be encrypted
 -transparent data encryption(tde) available for Orcle and SQL Server
 

In flight encryption
  - SSL certificates to encrpyt data to RDS in flight
  - Provide SSL options with trust certificate when connectiong to database
  -To enforce SSL:
     -postgreSQL: rds.force_ssl=l in AWS RDS Console(Parameter Groups)
     -MYSQL : Within the DB : 
       GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'mysqluser'@'%' REQUIRE SSL;
 
  RDS Encryption Operations
  -Encryption RDS backups 
     -Snpashpts of un-encrypyed RDS database are un-encrypted
     -Snpashpts of encrypyed RDS database are encrypted
     -Can copy a snapshot into an encrypted one
     
 To encrypt an un-encrypted RDS database:
   -Create a snapshot of the un-encrypted database
   -Copy to the snapshot and enable encryption for the snapshot
   -Restore the databse from the encryptes snapshot
   -migrate applications to encyrpted one
   
   
   
   RDS sECURITY -nETWORK & IAM
   -network Security 
      -RDS databses are usually deployed within a private subnet , not in a public one
      -RDS security works by leveraging security groups (the same concept as for EC2 instances) - it controls which IP/security group can communcate with RDS
      
   - Access Manageemnt
     -IAM plocies whelp who can manage AWS RDS(through the RDS API)
     -tRADITIONAL uSERNAME AND Password can be used to login into the databse
     -IAM-based authentocation can be used to login into RDS MySQL & PostgreSQL
     
     
   RDS -IAM Authentication
    -IAM database authenication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL
    -You dont need a password , just and authentication token obtained through IAM & RDS API Clls
    -Auth token has a lifetime if 15 minutes
    -Benefits :
     -Network in/out must be encrypted using SSL
     -IAM to centrally manage users instead of DB
     -Can leverage IAM roles and EC2 instance profiles for easy integration
