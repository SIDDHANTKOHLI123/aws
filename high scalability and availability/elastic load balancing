Load balance are servers that forwars traffic to multiple servers downstream

Why ?
- SPread load across mulktiple downstream instances
Expose a single point of access(DNS) to your applicatipn
Seamlessly handle failures if downstream instances
Do regular health checks to your instances
Provide SSL termination(HTTPS) for your webistes
Enforce stickiness with cookies
High availability across zones
Seprate ppublic traffic from private traffic


Health Chcks
-They are crucial for Load Balancers
-they enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are avaialble to reply to requests
-The health check is done on a port and a route
- If response is not 200(ok_ , then the instance is unhealthy
