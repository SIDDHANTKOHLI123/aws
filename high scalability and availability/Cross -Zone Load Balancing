Cross Zone Load Balancing - each load balancer instance dsitributes evenly accross all registered instances in all AZ

Without crozz zone requests are distributedd in the instances of the node of the Elastic Load balancer

Suppopse there are 2 zones , ( AZ1 and AZ2) tehy ar e2 and 8 instances in each respectively . With cross zone the load will be going ( 100 / (2+8) ) = 10 % each to each EC2 
For non cross the load will transfered to 50 % per each node . The first will be getting (50/2 =25% per each instamce) , 25/6 = 6.25 % per EC2
